I feel a lot of, that I know a lot about how people around you feel. SPEAKER_01: Even when you share stories from when you were younger. It's always about how people are feeling. SPEAKER_01: And if you could share anything right now that would be about you, that would be, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm stuttering. SPEAKER_01: That would be about you right now to let us in would be great. SPEAKER_01: Vonna you don't need to say I'm sorry every time you have a comment to make. Are you aware that you do that? SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yes. I just, I just, I just feel like I'm wrong. SPEAKER_01: You just feel like what? SPEAKER_01: I'm wrong I don't know. SPEAKER_02: Can we flag that and come back to that in a moment because I think that you're onto something really important with Gil. SPEAKER_02: So I'm going to ask you to push him. Can you do that? SPEAKER_02: I think so. SPEAKER_01: So Gil, in your relationship with Rose, you talk a lot about how she's very controlling and she won't give you a child and she's cold to you. SPEAKER_01: Is there any reason why you might think that she would act that way? SPEAKER_00: I just, I just still am having a hard time feeling that my, what's going on in my life is all that important Julius. SPEAKER_00: I can only imagine what you're going through and here I am complaining about a nagging wife and I mean in the end so maybe I don't have a child. SPEAKER_00: Maybe I'm not supposed to have, maybe I'm not supposed to have a child. SPEAKER_02: What would it be like? Wait a minute. We don't have Rose here. SPEAKER_02: We only can imagine what Rose is like. SPEAKER_02: So let me ask you this question. Rebecca, Bonnie, Pam, if you were married to Gil based upon what you know of Gil through this group, what would it be like to be his wife? SPEAKER_02: How would that feel? SPEAKER_01: It would feel like I was outside knocking on a door and then I would have to knock louder and knock harder and do different things in order to get attention. SPEAKER_02: I was going to say something similar actually. I would feel like I was screaming at a wall trying to get through to you."""

    return """SPEAKER_01: Welcome everyone to our group session today. I'd like to check in with each of you about how your week has been. Maya, would you like to start? SPEAKER_03: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately with work. The deadline pressure is intense, and I've started having trouble sleeping again. SPEAKER_03: I wake up at 3 AM almost every night with my heart racing, thinking about all the things I haven't finished. SPEAKER_03: My partner says I've been irritable and distant. He's trying to be supportive, but I just don't have the energy to connect right now. SPEAKER_01: Thank you for sharing that, Maya. What do you notice in your body when you're feeling this way? SPEAKER_03: My shoulders are always tight, and I get these tension headaches. Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe properly. SPEAKER_03: I've been trying to use that breathing technique we talked about last session, but it's hard to remember when I'm in the middle of panicking. SPEAKER_02: I can relate to that feeling of being overwhelmed. For me, it's my kids and my parents. I'm stretched so thin trying to care for everyone. SPEAKER_02: Sometimes I fantasize about just getting in my car and driving away. Not forever, just for a little while to catch my breath. SPEAKER_02: Then I feel terrible for even thinking that. What kind of mother thinks about leaving? SPEAKER_01: That sounds like a lot of self-judgment, Sarah. We've talked about how those thoughts are actually quite common and don't reflect on your worth as a parent. SPEAKER_00: I think I do the opposite. When things get too intense with my emotions, I just shut down. SPEAKER_00: My wife Rachel keeps telling me that I never share what I'm feeling. She says it's like living with a robot sometimes. SPEAKER_00: The truth is, I don't even know what I'm feeling half the time. It's just this emptiness. SPEAKER_01: David, that disconnection from your emotions is something we've been working on. Have you tried that journaling exercise? SPEAKER_00: I tried a couple times, but it feels pointless. I just stare at the blank page and nothing comes. SPEAKER_00: It's easier to just focus on work or fixing things around the house. At least then I feel useful. SPEAKER_04: I've been struggling with that too, David. After my divorce, I threw myself into my job. SPEAKER_04: But last week, my daughter told me she feels like I don't have time for her anymore. That was a wake-up call. SPEAKER_04: I realized I've been using work to avoid dealing with my feelings of failure about my marriage ending. SPEAKER_01: That's an important insight, James. How did it feel to hear that from your daughter? SPEAKER_04: Horrible. Like I was failing at being a father too. But also... I don't know, maybe grateful? SPEAKER_04: It forced me to see what I've been doing. I actually took a day off work this week to take her hiking. We talked more than we have in months. SPEAKER_03: How do you do that though? I feel like if I took a day off, the anxiety would be even worse. SPEAKER_03: My self-worth is so tied to my productivity. If I'm not working, who am I even? SPEAKER_02: I've been seeing this therapist individually who suggested I write down negative thoughts and challenge them. SPEAKER_02: Like when I think "I'm a bad mother for wanting time alone," I try to reframe it as "I need to care for myself to be present for my children." SPEAKER_02: It helps sometimes, but other times the guilt is just too strong. SPEAKER_01: Thank you for sharing that technique, Sarah. Maya, does that sound like something that might be helpful for your situation? SPEAKER_03: Maybe. I just don't see how changing my thoughts fixes the fact that I have too much to do and not enough time. SPEAKER_00: I tried medication for a while last year. The doctor said I have depression. SPEAKER_00: It helped a little, but I hated the side effects. I stopped taking it after three months. SPEAKER_00: Rachel doesn't know I stopped. She thinks I'm still on it. SPEAKER_01: That sounds like an important piece of information you're keeping from your partner, David. What prevents you from telling her? SPEAKER_00: She'll be disappointed. She thought the medication was helping our relationship. SPEAKER_00: And maybe it was. But I felt like a different person on it, not necessarily a better one. SPEAKER_04: I've found that exercise helps me manage my stress better than anything else. SPEAKER_04: When I'm running, it's the only time my brain shuts off from all the negative thoughts. SPEAKER_04: Before the divorce, I'd stopped taking care of myself physically. Getting back to it has been one small positive. SPEAKER_02: I wish I had time for exercise. Between the kids and my parents' care, I barely have time to shower. SPEAKER_02: My way of coping has been these little moments of connection with my kids. Like reading them bedtime stories. SPEAKER_02: For those few minutes, I'm just present and nothing else matters. SPEAKER_01: These are all important reflections on how you're managing difficult emotions and situations. For our remaining time today, I'd like to focus on one small step each of you might take this week."""

    """Return a therapy conversation focused on depression."""
    return """SPEAKER_01: Today, I'd like to focus our discussion on how everyone has been managing their mood this past week. Let's start with a check-in. SPEAKER_03: I've been having a really difficult time getting out of bed in the mornings. It takes me at least an hour to convince myself it's worth it. SPEAKER_03: Everything feels like such an effort. Even showering feels exhausting some days. SPEAKER_03: My husband keeps telling me to just push through it, but he doesn't understand how heavy everything feels. SPEAKER_01: That heaviness you're describing is important to acknowledge, Lisa. How long have you been experiencing this level of difficulty? SPEAKER_03: It's been getting worse over the past month. I think it started after I didn't get that promotion at work. SPEAKER_03: I keep replaying everything I said in that interview and thinking about how I failed. SPEAKER_03: I feel like such a disappointment to my family. They were all expecting me to get it. SPEAKER_00: I understand what you mean about the heaviness. For me, it's like wearing a weighted blanket all the time. SPEAKER_00: My doctor increased my antidepressant dosage last month, and it's helping a little bit, but the side effects are annoying. SPEAKER_00: I've gained weight, which honestly just makes me feel worse about myself. SPEAKER_02: Have you tried any other treatments besides medication? I've been doing this light therapy thing every morning. SPEAKER_02: My therapist recommended it for seasonal depression. I was skeptical at first, but I do notice a difference when I skip a day. SPEAKER_02: The hardest part for me is the negative thoughts. I can't seem to stop criticizing myself for every little thing. SPEAKER_01: That's a good point about alternative treatments. What kinds of things have others tried that have been helpful? SPEAKER_04: I've been forcing myself to go for a walk every day, even when I don't feel like it. Especially when I don't feel like it. SPEAKER_04: The first 10 minutes are always awful, but by the end, I usually feel at least a little better. SPEAKER_04: My biggest struggle is isolation. I keep canceling plans with friends because it feels too overwhelming to socialize. SPEAKER_03: I do that too. Then I feel guilty for being a bad friend, which makes me want to isolate more. It's a terrible cycle. SPEAKER_03: My sister suggested I try journaling, but whenever I sit down to write, I just end up listing all the things that are wrong with me. SPEAKER_01: It sounds like self-criticism is a common theme for many of you. How do you respond to those critical thoughts when they arise? SPEAKER_00: I try to distract myself. TV, video games, anything to drown out the thoughts. It doesn't really solve the problem, but it gives me temporary relief. SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I use alcohol too, which I know isn't healthy. My doctor warned me about mixing it with my medication. SPEAKER_00: But sometimes it's the only way I can fall asleep without my mind racing with all the ways I've failed. SPEAKER_02: I've been trying this thing where I talk to myself like I would talk to a friend. It's really hard. SPEAKER_02: If a friend came to me feeling the way I do, I would never say the things to them that I say to myself. SPEAKER_02: Sometimes it helps to just notice how harsh I'm being and try to soften it a little bit. SPEAKER_01: That's a very insightful approach. Self-compassion can be a powerful tool when dealing with depression. SPEAKER_04: My problem is that I put on a happy face for everyone. Nobody at work has any idea I'm struggling. SPEAKER_04: It's exhausting maintaining that facade. By the time I get home, I have nothing left. SPEAKER_04: My wife gets frustrated because she feels like she gets the worst of me, and everyone else gets the best. SPEAKER_01: Managing different faces for different contexts can be incredibly draining. How do others handle that balance? SPEAKER_03: I don't even bother with the mask anymore. I called in sick three times last week because I couldn't face people. SPEAKER_03: My boss is starting to get concerned. I'm afraid I might lose my job if this continues. SPEAKER_03: But the thought of finding a new job feels completely impossible right now. SPEAKER_01: That concern about employment adds another layer of stress. Has anyone found ways to manage work responsibilities during difficult periods?"""

def get_anxiety_focused_conversation():
    """Return a therapy conversation focused on anxiety."""
    return """SPEAKER_01: Welcome everyone. Today I thought we could discuss how anxiety has been showing up in your lives this week. Who would like to start? SPEAKER_02: I had a panic attack in the grocery store on Tuesday. It was so embarrassing. SPEAKER_02: I was standing in the checkout line and suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. My heart was racing and I got really dizzy. SPEAKER_02: I abandoned my cart and just ran out to my car. Sat there for 30 minutes trying to calm down. SPEAKER_01: That sounds really intense, Karen. What do you think triggered it? SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure exactly. The store was crowded, and I started worrying that people were looking at me. SPEAKER_02: Then I started thinking about all the things I needed to do this week, and it just snowballed from there. SPEAKER_02: I've been avoiding going back since then, which is a problem because we need groceries. SPEAKER_04: I've had similar experiences. For me, it's meetings at work. I get so anxious about speaking up. SPEAKER_04: Yesterday my boss asked me a direct question, and I could feel everyone staring at me. My mind went completely blank. SPEAKER_04: I've started making excuses to skip meetings, but I'm worried people are noticing and thinking I'm not committed to my job. SPEAKER_00: I get physical symptoms too. My doctor actually thought I had a heart condition at first. SPEAKER_00: I get chest pains, shortness of breath, tingling in my hands. It's terrifying even though I know it's "just anxiety." SPEAKER_00: I've started carrying a prescription sedative with me everywhere. Sometimes just knowing I have it helps me feel calmer. SPEAKER_03: Mine manifests as constant worry. I can't turn my brain off, especially at night. SPEAKER_03: I lie awake thinking about everything that could go wrong. What if my son fails his classes? What if my husband loses his job? SPEAKER_03: Then I'm exhausted the next day, which makes everything feel even more overwhelming. SPEAKER_01: It sounds like many of you are describing how anxiety affects your sleep. How have you been trying to manage that? SPEAKER_02: I've been using a meditation app. It helps sometimes, but other nights my thoughts are too loud to focus on the guidance. SPEAKER_02: My doctor suggested cutting out caffeine after noon, which I've been trying. I think it's helping a little bit. SPEAKER_02: The hardest part is that the anxiety itself makes me afraid to go to sleep, because I know how difficult it will be. SPEAKER_03: I've found that writing down all my worries before bed sometimes helps get them out of my head. SPEAKER_03: I also keep a notepad next to my bed, so if I wake up worrying about something, I can write it down and tell myself I'll deal with it tomorrow. SPEAKER_03: But honestly, some nights nothing helps. I just have to accept it will be a bad night and try again tomorrow. SPEAKER_00: My therapist taught me this progressive muscle relaxation technique. You tense and then release each muscle group. SPEAKER_00: It helps me recognize how much physical tension I'm carrying. Sometimes I don't even realize how tense I am until I consciously relax. SPEAKER_00: I've also completely stopped watching the news. It was just adding more things to worry about that I can't control. SPEAKER_04: I've been trying exposure therapy on my own. Forcing myself to speak up at least once in every meeting. SPEAKER_04: It's absolutely terrifying, but my therapist says the anxiety will eventually decrease if I keep facing it. SPEAKER_04: So far, it hasn't gotten much easier, but I'm trying to trust the process. SPEAKER_01: That's a great example of gradually facing fears. Has anyone else been working on confronting anxiety-provoking situations? SPEAKER_02: I made myself go back to the grocery store yesterday. Not the same one where I had the panic attack, but a smaller one. SPEAKER_02: I went during off-hours when it wouldn't be crowded. I had my husband on standby in case I needed to call him. SPEAKER_02: I managed to get what we needed, but I was exhausted afterward from being so tense the whole time. SPEAKER_03: I'm still struggling with that. It's easier to just avoid things that make me anxious. SPEAKER_03: My daughter wanted me to attend her school performance, but the thought of being in that crowded auditorium was too much. SPEAKER_03: I hate that my anxiety is affecting her now too. She was so disappointed when I didn't go. SPEAKER_01: That's a really difficult position to be in. The impact on our relationships can be another layer of distress. SPEAKER_00: My family has started to adapt to my anxiety in ways that aren't always helpful. SPEAKER_00: My wife automatically takes over in social situations because she knows they're hard for me. SPEAKER_00: I appreciate it, but it also makes me feel like I'm not capable, which feeds the anxiety even more. SPEAKER_01: That's an important insight about how well-meaning accommodations can sometimes reinforce anxiety. For our remaining time, let's talk about one small step each of you might take this week to work with your anxiety."""

def get_relationship_focused_conversation():

    return """SPEAKER_01: Today I'd like us to explore how your mental health affects your relationships, and vice versa. Who would like to begin? SPEAKER_03: My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately. He says I'm too negative all the time. SPEAKER_03: I don't think he understands that I can't just "cheer up" or "look on the bright side" when I'm depressed. SPEAKER_03: Last night he told me he's tired of walking on eggshells around me. That really hurt. SPEAKER_01: That sounds painful, Maria. How did you respond when he said that? SPEAKER_03: I shut down. What could I say? He's not entirely wrong. I know I'm difficult to live with right now. SPEAKER_03: But hearing him say it out loud made me feel even more worthless and guilty. SPEAKER_03: Sometimes I think he'd be better off without me dragging him down. SPEAKER_00: I'm having the opposite problem with my wife. She's trying too hard to "fix" my anxiety. SPEAKER_00: Every time I mention feeling anxious, she has a suggestion. Try this breathing technique, use this app, have you called your doctor? SPEAKER_00: I know she means well, but sometimes I just want her to listen, not solve the problem. SPEAKER_04: My relationship ended because of my PTSD. The nightmares, the irritability, the emotional numbness... SPEAKER_04: She said she couldn't handle it anymore. Said she felt more like my therapist than my girlfriend. SPEAKER_04: The worst part is I don't blame her. I wouldn't want to be with me either. SPEAKER_01: It sounds like there's a lot of self-blame in the room today. What about others' experiences? SPEAKER_02: I hide a lot of my symptoms from my husband. He doesn't know how often I have panic attacks. SPEAKER_02: I wait until he's at work or asleep. I don't want him to worry or think I'm getting worse. SPEAKER_02: But keeping that secret makes me feel distant from him, like he doesn't really know me. SPEAKER_01: That raises an important question about vulnerability in relationships. How do you decide what to share and what to keep private? SPEAKER_03: I've stopped telling my husband when I'm having a really bad day because I don't want to be a burden. SPEAKER_03: But then I get upset when he doesn't notice I'm struggling. It's not fair to him, I know. SPEAKER_03: Our therapist says I need to communicate more clearly, but it's hard to ask for what you need when you feel like you don't deserve help. SPEAKER_00: My wife and I have developed a rating system. I tell her my anxiety is at a 7 today, or whatever. SPEAKER_00: It helps her know what to expect, and it's easier than trying to explain exactly how I'm feeling. SPEAKER_00: On really high number days, she knows I need extra space and might not be very talkative. SPEAKER_01: That sounds like a helpful system. Has anyone else found effective ways to communicate about their mental health? SPEAKER_04: I'm not in a relationship now, but I'm terrified of starting one. How do you even explain all this to someone new? SPEAKER_04: When do you tell them? First date? "Hi, nice to meet you, I have debilitating PTSD that might make me wake up screaming." SPEAKER_04: But waiting too long feels dishonest. It's this impossible situation. SPEAKER_02: I worry about the impact on my kids. My 10-year-old asked me why I always look worried. SPEAKER_02: I don't know how much to explain to them about anxiety without scaring them or burdening them with adult problems. SPEAKER_02: My husband thinks we should be more open, but I want to protect them. SPEAKER_01: That's a common dilemma for parents. How do others navigate mental health discussions with children or other family members? SPEAKER_03: My teenage daughter knows I have depression. She's actually really understanding. SPEAKER_03: Sometimes too understanding. She's started trying to take care of me, which isn't her job. SPEAKER_03: I'm worried she'll end up like me, always putting others' needs before her own. SPEAKER_00: My parents don't believe anxiety is real. They think I just need to "toughen up." SPEAKER_00: So I've stopped talking to them about it. Which means our relationship stays very surface-level. SPEAKER_00: My wife gets frustrated because she thinks I should stand up to them more, but it's easier to just avoid the conflict. SPEAKER_01: It sounds like many of you are balancing difficult trade-offs in your relationships. For our remaining time, I'd like to explore what one small change might look like in your most challenging relationship."""
